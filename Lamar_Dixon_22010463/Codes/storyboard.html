	<h4>Theme</h4>
	<p>Imagine stepping into a digital time machine when you visit my website. It's like a peaceful trip down memory lane, where you're instantly embraced by a soothing retro vibe. The pages are designed to be clean and simple, with words gently framed in almost see-through white containers. This approach makes it easy for you to really focus on what's written, to absorb the stories and ideas I'm sharing without distraction. There is more than just text, carefully selected images help you connect with the people and subjects I'm discussing. </p>

	<h4>Intent</h4>
	<p>My genuine intent with this website is to tell you about myself and add a little fun and colour to my website, at first I was going to go with a dark theme but changed it. The reason for the change is because my head is most times in a negative place so this website represents the opposite in the effort  of trying to change my mood </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Home Page: I went for a simple design for the home page just to save the content for later and just give you a warm welcome to my page.</li>
		<li>Professional: It was designed like this because I have seen on many websites before that it was designed like this the picture of me fighting to stay 		    awake because I was doing so many assignments I went to bed at 4 am, so basically it's just a meme to livin' up my page. </li>
		<li>Personality: Just to show off myself, my goals and inspiration for everything I do.</li>
		<li>Development: Just a simple design to provide you with all the information I have, just because there is a lot of information I set it neatly bust 		    providing all the information</li>
		<li>Storyboard: Just to provide all the information about my website.</li>
		<li>Refrence: Just used to provide the information.</li>
