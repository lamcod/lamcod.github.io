	<h3>Summary on the Twelve Pillars</h3>
	<h4>Chapter 4 </h4>
	<p>This chapter emphasizes how having an optimistic outlook can change the way your life turns out. It shines a light on the profound impact that maintaining an optimistic and constructive mindset can have on various aspects of your existence, including your success, relationships, and overall well-being. In essence, it's about realizing that life is your canvas and your attitude is like the artist's palette. Choosing to paint with bright and hopeful colours, even when faced with challenging situations, can be the brushstroke that reshapes your world. You may design your relationships and accomplishments by intentionally choosing to have a more positive outlook. It's akin to turning the key that unlocks the doors of opportunity and sets the stage for a brighter and more fulfilling</p>

	<section><h4>Chapter 5</h4>
	This chapter is like a beloved friend encouraging you to take control of the steering wheel of your life. It's a call to action, a reminder that success isn't going to knock on your door while you wait passively. It emphasizes that attaining success is an active process rather than a spectator sport. Imagine this: You are the explorer in the great adventure that is life. Imagine yourself at the edge of an unknown jungle. You could either wait for someone else to pave the way or, as this chapter suggests, grab your machete and start cutting a path.</section>

	<h4>Chapter 6</h4>
	<p>Consider that you are the captain of a ship called Life. The compass in Chapter 6 will help you navigate the choppy waters of success and personal development. It underscores the importance of personal responsibility, which is like the steering wheel of your life's vessel. You are reminded in this chapter that every choice you make determines the route your ship will take. Whether it's a major life choice or a minor decision, it's like adjusting the sails. You have the ability to decide where you are going, and that comes with responsibility for your final destination. Imagine this: Life is full of choices, like a sea filled with islands. Some are lovely and plentiful, while others are perilous and difficult.</p>

	<h4>Chapter 7</h4>
	<p>Consider Chapter 7 as your individual road map for navigating life. It places a spotlight on the vital role of setting clear, meaningful goals, which are like the North Star guiding your path through the vast sea of existence.
Imagine you are setting out on a long journey, and the lighthouses that will guide you are your destinations. They not only provide direction but also a sense of purpose, much like a mariner setting sail for a distant and exciting destination.</p>

           <h4>Application</h4>
	<p>From these chapters you can apply it to your day-to-day school life. Chapter 4 is about attitude other than stressing if an assignment is hard or not just do the assignment and try to get as much done in the time period you have, rather than just sitting there wasting time stressing about it. Chapter 5 is about Activities other than sitting down procrastinating or waiting on the right time to start something, it would be better if you start it as you get it to make life easier for your future self and you have the ability to relax and study when it comes down to exam time. Chapter 6 is on Personal Responsibility which you can apply by taking responsibility rather than blaming others for the problem for example a group project am doing is not going so well and before I blame anybody for the situation I look into myself for a solution. Chapter 7 is on goals, now everyone has goals they can be split into major and minor goals right now. My only two goals at the moment are to start a business and pass so I can go to year 3.</p>
