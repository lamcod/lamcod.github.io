				<h3>Qualities</h3>
					<p>Resilience is my most valuable quality, and it has revolutionized my academic career. I can just imagine myself in the middle of a challenging semester trying to manage my workload and it feels almost overwhelming. It might be tough to balance the strain of challenging homework with personal difficulties, but this is where my resilience shines. Instead of giving in to discouragement when I face setbacks or obstacles, I see them as opportunities for growth. These low marks are not barriers to my growth but I see them as small stepping stones to my success. This mindset allows me to bounce back stronger than ever. I have learnt to ask for assistance when I need it to modify my study methods and put out the effort necessary to fully comprehend the content. During my first year of college, this trait really came forth. I was really stressed out, especially with the programming worksheet which sometimes gave me problems with the programs and I was there for hours trying to fix everything. It would have been easy to give up or take the easy way out, but my resilience wouldn't allow it. I just ask for help when needed and try my best to come up with solutions to my problems.</p>

				<h3>My Favourite Quote and Hero</h3>
	 				<p>One of my favourite quotes comes from David Goggins who is a Retired Navy SEAL and the only member of the U.S. Armed Forces to complete SEAL training, Army Ranger School, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller training. It won’t always go your way, so you can’t get trapped in this idea that just because you’ve imagined a possibility for yourself you somehow deserve it. Your entitled mind is dead weight. Cut it loose. Don’t focus on what you think you deserve. Take aim at what you are willing to earn!".David Goggins is my hero because he is more than just an inspirational figure; he is someone I deeply connect with. His incredible journey from adversity to triumph resonates with my personality. The life of Goggins, who experienced a rough upbringing, weight problems and other challenges is a monument to the amazing power of the human spirit to evolve. His 40% Rule is a constant reminder that our potential far exceeds what we often believe and it encourages me to keep pushing beyond my comfort zone. Beyond his athletic prowess, what truly distinguishes him is his dedication to self-improvement and his desire to change the world by bringing attention to pressing issues and aiding philanthropic endeavours. David Goggins's relentless pursuit of self-betterment and his ability to conquer things that other people think are impossible.</p>

	<h3>Thoughts</h3>
	<p>In David Keirsey's temperament theory, the Guardian temperament is characterized by traits such as strong duty, practicality, and a focus on maintaining order and stability. Guardians are known for their reliability and sense of responsibility, taking commitments seriously in both personal and professional realms. They tend to be rule-followers who value tradition and respect established norms. Practical problem-solvers, they prefer realistic and workable solutions. Stability and security are paramount to Guardians, making them uncomfortable with sudden changes. They excel in attention to detail and often contribute to their communities, valuing a structured and dependable environment while respecting authority figures.</p>
